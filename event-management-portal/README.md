This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Prisma & Production DB

- Add a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel (Production) pointing to a managed database (Postgres, MySQL, Neon, PlanetScale, Supabase, Railway, etc.).
- Do NOT use SQLite in production on Vercel — the filesystem is ephemeral.

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs migrations and seeds on push to `main`. To enable it:

1. Add `DATABASE_URL` as a repository secret in GitHub (Settings → Secrets) with your production DB connection string.
2. Ensure Vercel has the same `DATABASE_URL` in Project Settings → Environment Variables (Production).
3. Push to `main` — the workflow will run `npx prisma migrate deploy` and `npx prisma db seed`.

If you'd rather run migrations during build, set Vercel's Build Command to:

```
npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma db seed && npm run build
```

If you'd like, I can add or adjust CI workflows or switch Prisma IDs to `Int` and update the app types.
